A Love You Can't Survive - Richard Thompson

Intro

Verse 1
Now I remember the promise I gave you
The night I shipped out as a peace volunteer
As we sat holding hands in the Lamb and Flag tavern
I swore I'd be back for you same time next year

But I killed a man in a Brazzaville street fight
I tried to hold back, but he taunted me so
5 years till they freed me from that Brazzaville prison
Out of boredom or pity, I never will know

Pre-Chorus
Now I bear the stain
The scar on my name
I never can go back again

Chorus
There's a love you can't survive
And it burns you up inside

Repeat Intro

Verse 2
I sailed my boat into New Orleans harbour
Tied up at the jetty, as bold as you please
With a half-ton of charlie built in to the bulkhead
Right under the noses of all them police

Now here I sit in my house on the mountain
King of the clouds and all I survey
There's women who are willing, and the law can't touch me
Yours is the one face that won't go away

Pre-Chorus

Chorus 
There's a love you can't survive
And it burns you up inside
There's a love a love
A love you cant survive
