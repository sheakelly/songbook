Old Thames Side - Richard Thompson

Verse 1
As I was walking down by old Thames side
Oh my foot and my heart seem to falter
And there you were standing by a Custom House landing
Like Venus risen out of the water

Chorus
And they say its because, well, Im a fool in love
That I swear theres no beauty before you
And those that deny or think that I lie
Well oh, those are the ones who never saw you

Verse 2
Oh, there never was anyone so perfect as you
As you stood there and smiled to greet me
And I searched for a phrase to capture your ways
Well, thats a task that'll always defeat me

Chorus x2
