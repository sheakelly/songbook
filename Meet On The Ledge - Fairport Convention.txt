Meet On The Ledge - Fairport Convention

Verse 1
We used to say that, come the day, we'd all be making songs
Or finding better words.  These ideas never lasted long.
The way is up along the road. The air is growing thin.
Too many friends who tried were blown off this mountain with the wind.

Chorus
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge.
When the time is up I'm gonna see all my friends.
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge.
If you really mean it, it all comes round again.

Intrumental

Verse 2
Now I see I'm all alone. But that's the only way to be.
You'll have your chance again; then you can do the work for me.
