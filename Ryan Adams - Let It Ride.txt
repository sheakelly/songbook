Intro

Verse 1
Am                                                  
Moving like the fog on the Cumberland River
         G                 C                   
I was leaving on the Delta Queen
      F      C        G
And I wasn't ready to go
F         C        G
I'm never ready to go
Am
27 years of nothing but failures
       G                     C
and promises that I couldn't keep, Oh Lord
      F      C        G 
And I wasn't ready to go
F         C        G
I'm never ready to go

Chorus
        Am         
Let it ride
            F    C        G   
Let it ride easy down the road
        Am               
Let it ride
            F        C      G
Let it take away all of the darkness
        Am
Let it ride
               F      C       G         C
Let it rock me in the arms of strangers angels
G
Until it brings me home
G                                Am - Intro Riff
Let it ride. Let it roll, Let it go

Verse 2
Am                                                            
Loaded like a sailor tumbling off a ferryboat
G                     C                    
I was at the bar till three, Oh Lord
      F      C        G 
And I wasn't ready to go
F         C        G
I'm never ready to go
Am
Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina
       G                 C
Where they were gonna bury me
      F      C        G 
And I wasn't ready to go
F         C        G
I'm never ready to go

Chorus

Repeat Intro Riff

Bridge
G
I wanna see you tonight
G
Dancing in the endless moonlight
F                      C
In a parking lot in the headlights of cars
G
Some place on the moon
G
Where they moved the drive-in theatre
F                                            
Where I left the car that I can't find
    C
but I still got the keys to

Chorus

Repeat Intro Riff
