Rake - Townes Van Zandt

Intro

Verse 1
Dm
Well, I used to wake
    F
and run with the moon
  G
I lived like a rake and a young man
  Dm
I covered my lovers
     F   
with flowers and wounds
   G
my laughter the devil would frighten.

    F              G
The sun, she would come
    C            Dm 
and beat me back down
    C                       Dm    
but every cruel day had its nightfall
    F           G
I'd welcome the stars
     C            Dm  
with wine and guitars
C                      Dm     
    full of fire and forgetful

Verse 2
My body was sharp
the dark air clean
and outrage my joyful companion
whisperin' women
how sweet did they seem
kneelin' for me to command them

And time was like water
but I was the sea
I wouldn't have noticed it passing
except for the turnin'
of night into day
and turnin' of day into cursin'

Repeat Intro

Verse 3
You look at me now
and don't think I don't know
what all your eyes are a sayin'
Does he want us to believe
these ravings and lies
they're just tricks that his brain's been a playin'?

A lover of women
he can't hardly stand
he trembles he's bent and he's broken
I've fallen it's true
but I say unto you
hold your tongues until after I've spoken

Repeat Intro

Verse 3
I was takin' my pride
in the pleasures I'd known
I laughed and said I'd be forgiven
but my laughter turned 'round
eyes blazin' and said my
friend, we're holding a wedding

I buried my face
but it spoke once again
night to the day we're a bindin'
and now the dark air
is like fire on my skin
and even the moonlight is blinding
