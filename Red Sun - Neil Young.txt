Red Sun - Neil Young

Intro

Verse 1
         C       G           D        C  
When the red sun sets on the Railroad town,
        D            Am7             G     C
And the bars begin to laugh with the happy sound;
               G          D       C
I'll still be here right by your side,
          D        Am7       G         C
There'll not be anyone in my heart but you.

Chorus
        D
And the dreams that you're having,
     G             C
They won't let you down,
       D           Em
If you just follow on,
           C          D      C
'Cause you know where you're bound;
    D
The well will be flowing,
        G               C
And the words will come fast,
         D         Em
When the one who's coming,
  C          D  C G/B Am7 D/F# (as intro)
Arrives here at last.

Verse 2
On the grassy hills of the Railroad town,
Where we cut through the fences and over the crown;
Where wind was blowing right through your hair,
I dreamt that my mommy and daddy were there.

Chorus

Instrumental

Verse 3
When the red sun sets on the Railroad town,
And the bars begin to laugh with the happy sound;
I'll still be here right by your side,
There'll not be another in my heart but you.
