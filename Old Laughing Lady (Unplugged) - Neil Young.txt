Intro
G    C G (Harp)

Verse 1
G
Don't call pretty Peggy,
C                     G
She can't hear you no more

Don't leave no message
C              G
Round her back door
             C
They say the old laughing lady
            G
Been here before
    D               C
She don't keep time
                G
She don't count score

Verse 2
G
You can't have a cupboard
C                 G
If there ain't no  wall

You got to move
C
There's no time for you to stall
             C            020010 Am
They say the old laughing lady
        C     D    G
Dropped by to call
    D               Am
And when she leaves
           C          G
She leaves nothing at all

Repeat verse 1 (Harp solo)

Verse 3
See the drunkard of the village
Fallin' on his feet
He can't tell his ankle
From the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady
Because the taste is so sweet
But the laughin' lady's loving
Ain't the kind he can keep

D Am C G (Harp)

Verse 4
There's a fever on the freeway
Blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway
Just don't feel right
There's a rumblin' in the bedroom
And a flashin' of light
There's the old laughing lady
Everything is all right
There's the old laughing lady
Everything is all right

D Am C G (Harp)
