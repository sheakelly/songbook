Think Again – Teddy Thompson



Riff



Verse 1

Walking away I feel ashamed,

Thinking of what I’ve done.

She was naïve and I was a sage

Some things can’t be undone.



Chorus

Think again, don’t give in,

This isn’t what you want.

Feelings change morning brings rain,

This isn’t what you want.



Verse 2

Hard to believe that I could be,

Someone’s idea of love.

I should have been and now of age 

Baby I’m not that strong.



Chorus



Bridge

I’m here today

But I won’t stay.



Riff
