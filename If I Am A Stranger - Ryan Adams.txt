If I Am A Stranger - Ryan Adams (Capo 3rd Fret)

Intro Riff

Verse 1
 Em                         G6 
For all the hours here that move too slow
                 C
There's all this letting go, that don't pass
Em                        G6
If all this love is real, how will we know?
         C
If we're only scared of losing it, how will it last?


Chorus
Dadd4     Em                 C  G
If I am a stranger now to you
       C      G          C      Dadd4
I will always be, I will always be
Dadd4             Em                  C G
Stronger now then me, stronger then you
              C      G
Our love will always be
          C      Dadd4                          C
And if we let it go, I will try to be there for you

If I can, what if I can't?

Repeat Intro Riff

Verse 2
Today is yesterday when you don't know
How to rebuild the walls that someone has knocked down
To tell the truth it's hard enough about a lover
Who you want to hide your darkness from
So they won't let you down

Chorus
If I am a stranger now to you
I will always be, I will always be
Stronger now then me, stronger then you
Our love will always be
                     Dadd4                          C
And if we let it go, I will try to be there for you
                            Dadd4
I will try and be there for you
If I can, what if I can't?

Verse
For all the hours here that move to slow                              
There's all this letting go, that won't pass
If all this love is real, how will we know?
And if were only scared of losing it, how will it last?

Chorus
If I am a stranger now to you
I will always be, I will always be
Stronger now then me, stronger than you
Our love will always be
If we let it go, I will try to be there for you
I will try to be there for you
I will try to be there for you
If I can, what if I can't?
