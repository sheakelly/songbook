Lungs - Steve Earle

Intro

Verse 1
Now won't you lend your lungs to me? Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe up the time that's passing
Breath I take and breath I give, pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live in lonely indecision

Verse 2
My fingers walked the darkness down, mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found, you fool it's only moonlight
If you try to take it home your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone try to find another

Verse 3
Salvation sat and crossed herself and called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf, who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at it's mouth, take the water's prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries, bathe in fiery answers

Intrumental (like intro)

Verse 4 
Jesus was an only son and love His only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues and dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two ain't got the time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you, we'll tell the world we tried
