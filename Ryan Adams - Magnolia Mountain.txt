Magnolia Mountain - Ryan Adams

Intro Riff

Verse 1
Bm               D
I want to go to Magnolia Mountain
     A                 E
And lay my weary head down
             G            D                      A
Down on the rocks on the mountain my savior made
Bm                 D
Steady my soul and ease my worry
A                             E
Hold me when I rattle like a hummingbird hummin'
G                           D                      A
Tie me to the rocks on the mountain my savior made

Chorus 1
C#m     G#m
Lie to me
DII        AII
Sing me a song
C#m        G#m            F#
Sing me a song until the morning comes
        C#m     G#m             D      A
If the morning comes, will you lie to me
          C#m                          G#m
Will you take me to your bed will you lay me down
          F#
Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed that my savior made

Verse 2
I want to be the bluebird singing
Singing to the roses in her yard   
The roses in her yard her father grew for her
It's been raining that Tennessee honey
So long I got too heavy to fly
Ain't no bluebird ever gets too heavy to sing

Chorus 2
Lie to me
Sing me a song
Sing me a song until the morning comes
If the morning don't come, will you lie to me
Will you take me to your bed will you lay me down
Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed that my savior made

Instrumental

Verse 3
We burned the cotton fields down in the valley
And ended up with nothing but scars
The scars became the lessons that we gave to our children after the war
But there ain't nothing but the truth up on the Magnolia Mountain
Where nobody ever dies
Steady your soul and ease your worry they got a room for you

Chrous 3
Lie to me
Like I lied to you
Calm me down until the morning comes
If the morning don't come, lie to me
Will you take me to your bed will you lay me down
Till I'm heavy like the rocks on the riverbed that my savior made for us
