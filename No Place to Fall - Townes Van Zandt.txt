No Place to Fall - Towns Van Zandt

(Capo on Second fret)

Verse 1
D        DMaj7       D7
If I had no place to fall
      G      D
and I needed to
        Em       G
could I count on you
          D
to lay me down?
D         Dmaj7       D7
I'd never tell you no lies
          G          D
I don't believe it's wise
        Em     G
you got pretty eyes
                   D
won't you spin me 'round

        Em                   A
I ain't much of a lover it's true
    Em            F#m
I'm here then I'm gone
        D       E
and I'm forever blue
        A
but I'm sure wanting you

Verse 2
Skies full of silver and gold
try to hide the sun
but it can't be done
least not for long

And if we help each other grow
while the light of day
smiles down our way
then we can't go wrong

Chrous
Time, she's a fast old train
she's here then she's gone
and she won't come again
won't you take my hand

Verse 3
If I had no place to fall
and I needed to
could I count on you
to lay me down?
