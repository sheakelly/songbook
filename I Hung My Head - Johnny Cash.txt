C F

Verse 1
C                      F                 
Early one morning with time to kill
  Am                       F  
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
  C                F 
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
  Am                    F
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
  Dm                    G
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
                C
A shot rang out across the land
    F                         Am  
The horse he kept running the rider was dead
  C              F
I hung my head, I hung my head

Verse 2
I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me why had I run
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

Verse 3
Here in the courthouse the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
"Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find"
I said "I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead"
I hung my head, I hung my head

Verse 4
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together 'til kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
