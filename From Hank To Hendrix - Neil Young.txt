Verse 1
G            Bm
From Hank to Hendrix
C                           Am
I walked these streets with you
Em                  G
Here I am with this old guitar
C            Am
doin' what I do
G             Bm
I always expected
C                     Am
That you would see me through
Em               G
I never believed in much
C                 Am    G
But I believed in you

Chorus
F
Can we get it together,
       C                   G
can we still stand side by side
F
Can we make it last,
C              G (hold)
like a musical ride

Verse 2
From Marilyn to Madonna
I've always loved your smile
Now headed for the big divorce
California style
I can hear myself singin'
Like a long lost friend
The same thing that makes you live
Can kill you in the end

Chorus

Verse 3
Sometimes it's distorted
And not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love
Just comes ringin' through
New glass in the windows
New leaf on tree
New distance between us
You and Me

Chorus
