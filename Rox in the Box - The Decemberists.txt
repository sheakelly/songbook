Rox in the Box - The Decemberists

Intro riff

Verse 1
Am
Get the rocks in the box
C                                  C/Em 
Get the water right down to your socks
      Em                                  Am
This bulkhead's built of fallen brethren bones
Am
We all do what we can
C                    C/Em
We endure our fellow man
        Em                                           Am
And we sing our songs to the headframes' creaks and moans

Chorus
         F
And it's one two three
        C/G
On the wrong side of the lee
              G
What were you meant for?
              Am
What were you meant for?
          F
And it's seven eight nine
              C/G
You get your shuffle back in line
    G                                             Am
And if you ever make it to ten you won't make it again
    G                                             Am (Intro Riff)
And if you ever make it to ten you won't make it again

Verse 2
And you won't make a dime         
On this gray Granite Mountain Mine   
Of dirt you're made and to dirt you will return
So while we're living here
Let's get this little one thing clear
There's plenty of men to die you don't jump your turn
