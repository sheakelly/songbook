I Misunderstood - Richard Thompson

Verse 1
She said "Darling I'm in love with your mind.
The way you care for me, it's so kind.
Love to see you again, I wish I had more time".
She was laughing as she brushed my cheek
"Why don't you call me, angel, maybe next week
Promise now, cross your heart and hope to die".

Chorus
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye

Verse 2
Things I tried to put shine in her eyes
Wire wheels and shimmering things
Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly
She said "The thing that's so unique
When we're together we don't have to speak.
We'll always be such good friends, you and I"

Chorus
Oh but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying goodbye

Oh, she was saying goodbye, oh, she was saying goodbye
Oh, she was saying, saying, saying, saying
