The End - Ryan Adams

Intro
G              A      G           A      G   A  D D

Verse 1
D                G           D           D
I don’t know the sound of my father’s voice
D            D                   A           A
I don’t even know how he says my name
       G              A         Bm          G
But it plays out like song on a jukebox in a bar
       D          D/A            A             D        D
In the back of my head till it’s worrying machine          
And in the cotton fields by the house where I was born
The leaves burn like effigies of my kin
And the trains run like snakes through the Pentecostal pines
Filled up with cotton and dime store gin

Chorus
Bm                        G            D
Jacksonville,     how you burden in my soul
        A           G      Bm       
How you hold all my dreams captive
Bm                         G            D
Jacksonville,      how you play with my mind
       A          G
How my heart goes bad
     Bm            A           Bm            
Suffocating on the pines in Jacksonville

Intro
The end, the end, the end

Verse 2
All the cars are lined up on a Saturday night
With the sky full of nothing but moon
And I lose my reflection in the bottles of wine
Till the morning comes down and I ain't nothing but you
Now the diner in the morning for a plate of eggs
The waitress tries to give me change I say, "Nah, it's cool. Just keep it"
I read up my news, I start thinking about her
And I wonder if anybody here besides me has got any decent secrets

Chorus

Quiet Instrumental break
G      A    G     A     G   A  D D

Outro
The end, the end, the end
