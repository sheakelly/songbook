Lonely Stranger - Eric Clapton

Intro

Verse 1
I must be invisible no one knows me.
I have crawled down dead-end streets on my hands and knees.
I was born with a ragin' thirst, a hunger to be free,
But I've learned through the years. Don't encourage me.

Chorus
'Cause I'm a lonely stranger here, well beyond my day.
And I don't know what's goin' on, So I'll be on my way.

Verse 2
When I walk, stay behind, don't get close to me,
'Cause it's sure to end in tears, so just let me be.
Some will say that I'm no good, maybe I agree.
Take a look then walk away. That's all right with me.

Chorus
