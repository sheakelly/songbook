Persuasion - Richard Thompson

Intro Riff 1

Verse 1
You and I, tempted by the promise of a different life
Time has fled, there's a constant battle running through my head 
I don't know what to do 'cos I still believe     

Chorus
After all the foolish things that we've been through       
I could always make a start on something new      
I will always be a man who's open to
Persuasion

Repeat Riff 1

Verse 2
Blind romance, there'll be no half measures given half a chance
But we never learn, trusting in the fire while the cruel flame burns      
And we need to rebuild...what was never there    
What got left behind     

Chorus
After all the foolish things that we've been through       
I could always make a start on something new      
I will always be a man who's open to
Persuasion

And it's written in my heart so that everyone could see it
And it's written in my soul, after all I still believe it       
I still believe it      
I still believe it
I still believe it

Riff 1

I don't know what to do...'cos I still believe

Chorus

Persuasion x 4

I still believe it      
I still believe it
I still believe it
Oh persuasion
